## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/rahulgothwal5/WorkManager-Demo.git

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

## Usage

Explore the codebase to learn how to implement background tasks and scheduling them effectively using **WorkManager** in your Kotlin Android app. This project demonstrates three types of workers:

- **Periodic Workers**: These workers execute periodically at specified intervals.
- **Expedited Workers**: These workers execute as soon as possible.
- **OneTime Workers**: These workers execute once.

Make use of **Jetpack Compose** for UI, **Hilt Dependency Injection** for managing dependencies, and ensure adherence to **MVVM** and **Clean Code Architecture** principles.
